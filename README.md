# Modeling and Synthesis of Digital Systems Using Verilog and VHDL

This repository contains the solutions for the assignments from the 'Modeling and Synthesis of Digital Systems Using Verilog and VHDL' course (ECE574) taken at Worcester Polytechnic Institute - WPI in the Fall 2019. The repository includes 4 projects, namely:

0 - 4-to-16 Decoder (prelimenary project). </br>
1 - VGA Display and Light Sensor. </br>
2 - Memory Interface along with a Microblaze Embedded Processor (part 4 only, as including the techniques from parts 1-3). </br>
3 - Pong Game. </br>


The detailed information about the projects 1-3 is contained in the attached reports placed in the corresponding subfolders. </br>
IP cores were deleted from the projects to avoid copyright infringements.

# Used FPGA board
The above projects were designed for the Nexys A7 board, based on the xc7a100tcsg324-3 FPGA from Xilinx.
